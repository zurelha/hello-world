# hello-world
Hi, humans!

I started studying programming a short time ago.
I like JavaScript and everything it can do.
I want to become a dev web, or maybe dev mobile.
I'm brazilian, live in Rio de Janeiro.
I like games, moba games are my favoritos (LOL is the best game in the world).
My English is very basic, I can only form small sentences.
